            user performance, and determine winners. The specific judging
            criteria that will be utilized by the Oracle will be set in forth in
            the applicable Contest Details and may vary based on the type of
            Contest you participate in. If any ties must be broken to determine
            the winners, the Oracle will automatically choose a winner based on
            criteria stated in the Contest Details, which may vary on a
            Contest-by-Contest basis and may include without limitation: (a) the
            shortest total commit time across all answers in the applicable
            Contest, as determined by the Oracle; and/or (b) the earliest ticket

            Prizes and awards will vary on a Contest-by-Contest basis, relying

            number of winners and approximate retail value of each Contest will
            be set forth in the payout structure shown in the applicable Contest
            Details. Your odds of winning depend on the number of users in the

            Digital Assets cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to
            the relevant cryptocurrency network, although they may be in a
