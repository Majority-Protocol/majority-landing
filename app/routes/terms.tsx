            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold">(a)</span> You may participate in
              the Services, including any Games, and interact with the Protocol
              by linking your supported digital wallet(s) via the functionality
              of the Services or by creating a noncustodial digital asset wallet
              associated with your Majority Games account (
              <span className="font-semibold">"Wallet"</span>), which may be
              used to hold supported digital assets, such as USDC (
              <span className="font-semibold">"Digital Assets"</span>) for use
              on the Services. If you create a Wallet via the functionality of
              the Services, such functionality may be provided by a third party,
              and you acknowledge and agree to such third party's terms and
              conditions. Under no circumstances will Majority Games maintain
              control over or assume responsibility for your Wallet, Digital
              Assets, or any associated private keys.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold">(b)</span> You may store, track,
              transfer, and manage your balances of Digital Assets in your
              Wallet via the Services. When you or a third party sends Digital
              Assets to your Wallet address, the person initiating the
              transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction
              properly, which may include, among other things, payment of
              sufficient network or miner's fees in order for the transaction to
              be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause a transfer to
              remain in a pending state and may result in delays or loss
              incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the
              transaction. Transfers of Digital Assets cannot be reversed once
              they have been broadcast to the relevant cryptocurrency network,
              although they may be in a pending state, and designated
              accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network
              operators. Majority Games does not control the network and makes
              no guarantees that a transfer will be confirmed by the network.
              You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting
              them.
            </p>

              <span className="font-semibold">(c)</span> You control the
              cryptocurrencies held in your Wallet, and subject to having
              internet access and any congestion on the blockchain, you may
              withdraw your Digital Assets at any time by sending them to a
              different address on a compatible blockchain. Majority Games does
              not maintain control over your Wallet, Digital Assets or private
              keys. This means we cannot move funds on your behalf, nor can we
              help you access Digital Assets in your Wallet should you lose
              access to your Wallet. While Majority Games may, in its sole
              discretion, assist with or enable you to pay any transaction,
              network, and/or Protocol fees via the functionality of the
              Services, you acknowledge and agree that Majority Games has no
              obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions.

              Majority Games incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to
              digital assets that are not supported by Majority Games that are
              sent to a Wallet or with regard to Digital Assets sent to an
              incompatible digital asset wallet address and/or unsupported
              network or blockchain. All such erroneously transmitted Digital

            6. Transactions on the Protocol

            The Protocol may require fees for certain actions, including in
            connection with your participation in a Game which may require the
            payment of an entry fee. Any financial transaction you participate
            in will be carried out solely through the Protocol using the Wallet,
            and Majority Games merely provides an interface for you to transact
            on the Protocol. Majority Games does not control and will not have
            control over these payments or transactions, nor will Majority Games
            be able to reverse any transaction. Majority Games has no liability
            to you or any third party for any claims or damages that may arise
            as a result of any transaction you make through the Services or any
            other transaction you make through your Wallet and the Protocol. To
            the extent the Protocol requires the payment of a fee for each
            transaction conducted on the Services (including in connection with
            a Game), you acknowledge and agree you will be solely responsible
            for paying such applicable fee(s). In the event you are entitled to
            any amounts (such as Digital Assets) from the Protocol (such as in
            connection with your participation in a Game), such Transaction will
            occur solely via the functionality of the Protocol. Because Majority
            Games is merely an online interface provider, Majority Games is not
            responsible for or a party to such Transactions.

              create and host your own Games for other users of the Protocol, in
              each case via the functionality of the Services. Games, outcomes
              of Games, and corresponding Transactions (as defined below) may be
              recorded and documented on the Protocol. You acknowledge and agree
              that your participation in the Games will be subject to the
              Majority Games Standard Contest Rules, and you agree to such
              terms. In order to be eligible to participate in the Games, you
              must be in a jurisdiction where such Games are permitted to be
              offered, and you will automatically be disqualified if the Games
              may not be offered in your jurisdiction (which may include certain
              US-based states that prohibit the offering of contests structured
              like the Games, including: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut,

              Majority Games Standard Contest Rules, and you agree to be bound
              by such terms as the "Sponsor". You must include complete and
              accurate information about the eligibility requirements for users
              to participate in your Game (including the entry fee, if any) and
              any other details, specifications, rules, or requirements that may
              apply to your Game. While the Protocol and other blockchain
              technologies (such as the Oracle) will be responsible for
              administering and determining the winners of the Game (including
              addressing tiebreakers) based on the criteria applicable to such
              Game, you are solely responsible for all other aspects of Games
              you create and/or offer to other users of the Services, including
              without limitation the questions, answers, and other mechanics
              that may be necessary for the Protocol to provide the Game to
              users.

              may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify or suspend the Game
              any time prior to the conclusion of the Game (as such
              functionality is enabled by the specific Protocol smart contract
              governing the Game, or as otherwise communicated with respect to
              that particular Game). The applicable sponsor or host, including
              the Oracle, may also disqualify any player or winner as determined
              in its sole discretion.

              the Protocol and host, sponsor, and/or participate in Games
              utilizing the functionality of the Protocol, and accordingly
              Majority Games is not a party to and has no ability to mediate or
              resolve any disputes or challenges. Because of this, while the
              Services endeavor to reflect certain Protocol features,
              functionalities, and states (including any Game details), Majority
              Games makes no representation, warranty or guarantee that any
              functionality accurately reflects the state of the Protocol, and
              will not be responsible or liable to you for any such inaccuracy,
              delay, or error in transmission.

              dispute via the Oracle within the time period specified. If
              permitted in your jurisdiction, you release Majority Games (and
              its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, investors,
              subsidiaries, and employees) (collectively "Releasees") from, and
              covenant not to sue Releasees for any and all claims, demands, or

            achieved the criteria to receive a Referral Bonus. Your Referral
            Link should only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes.
            Distribution of your Referral Link in a manner that violates these
            Terms or applicable law, or any other use of the Referral Link in a

            </h3>
            <p>
              We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out
              of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination,
              enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the
              Services (collectively,{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold">"Disputes"</span>) will be
              resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a
              class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You
              and Majority Games agree that the Cayman Islands Arbitration Law
              governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and
              that you and Majority Games are each waiving the right to a trial
              by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration
              provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">(b) Exceptions</h3>
            <p>
              As limited exceptions to Section 19(a) above: (i) we both may seek
              to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and
              (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other
              equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the
              infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property
              rights.

              (c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules
            </h3>
            <p>
              Any Dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms, including
              the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or
              termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual
              obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to
              and finally resolved by binding arbitration to be administered by
              the Cayman International Mediation and Arbitration Centre (CI-MAC)
              and governed by the Arbitration Act (as amended) of the Cayman
              Islands. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English
              language and the place of arbitration shall be in the Cayman
              Islands. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The place of
              arbitration will be George Town, Cayman Islands. The decision of
              the sole arbitrator to any such dispute, controversy, difference
              or claim shall be final and binding upon both parties. If any
              litigation or arbitration is necessary to enforce the terms of
              this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to have
              their attorney fees paid by the other party. Each party waives any
              right it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens,
              to assert that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such
              arbitration or courts or to object to venue to the extent any
              proceeding is brought in accordance herewith.

              Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
              governed by the Arbitration Act (as amended) of the Cayman
              Islands, and we won't seek to recover the administration and
              arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the
              arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in
              arbitration we'll pay all of our attorneys' fees and costs and
              won't seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration
              you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses
              to the extent provided under applicable law.

              (e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
            </h3>
            <p>
              Except as provided in Section 19(b) above, the arbitrator shall
              determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim
              asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive
              relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and
              only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that
              party's individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on
              a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive
              relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting
              unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the
              entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a
              civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The
              parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive
              relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any
              individual claims in arbitration.

              PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties' Dispute is resolved through
              arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's
              claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
              form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific
              provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this
              Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
